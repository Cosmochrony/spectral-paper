\section{Spectral Distance and Embedding}
  \label{sec:spectral-distance-and-embedding}

  A central step in the reconstruction of geometry from relational data is
  defining a notion of distance that does not rely on a pre-existing metric or
  coordinate structure.
  In this section, we introduce the spectral notions of proximity and distance derived
  directly from relational connectivity and Laplacian operators.

  We consider a relational system represented by a graph or coarse-grained network
  endowed with a Laplacian operator $\Delta$.
  No embedding space or background geometry is assumed.
  The spectrum and eigenfunctions of $\Delta$ encode the connectivity structure of
  the system and constitute the only input for the following constructions.
  The relation between Laplacian spectra and the global connectivity properties
  of graphs is a central result of spectral graph theory~\cite{Chung1997}.
