\subsection{Scope and limitations}
  \label{subsec:scope-and-limitations}

  The constructions presented in this section are entirely kinematic in nature.
  They do not rely on assumptions regarding dynamics, temporal ordering, or causal
  structures.
  Their purpose was solely to establish how effective geometric notions can be
  reconstructed from spectral data associated with relational connectivity.

  The emergence of continuum geometry, curvature, and comparisons with known geometric
  solutions are addressed in the following sections.
