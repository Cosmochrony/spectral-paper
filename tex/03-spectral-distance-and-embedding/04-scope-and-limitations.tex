\subsection{Scope and limitations}
  \label{subsec:scope-and-limitations}

  The constructions presented in this section are entirely kinematical.
  They do not rely on assumptions about dynamics, temporal ordering, or causal
  structure.
  Their purpose is solely to establish how effective geometric notions may be
  reconstructed from spectral data associated with relational connectivity.

  The emergence of continuum geometry, curvature, and comparison with known geometric
  solutions are addressed in the following sections.
