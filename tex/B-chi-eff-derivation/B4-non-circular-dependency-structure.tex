\subsection{Non-circular dependency structure.}
  \label{subsec:non-circular-dependency-structure}
  The construction is explicitly hierarchical:
  \[
    d^{C} \;\Longrightarrow\; \bar{\chi}
    \;\Longrightarrow\; w(\bar{\chi}),\,K(\bar{\chi})
    \;\Longrightarrow\; d^{W}
    \;\Longrightarrow\; \chi_{\mathrm{eff}}.
  \]
  The neighborhood used to compute $\bar{\chi}$ is defined using $d^{C}$ and is therefore $\chi$-independent.
  The effective geometry is encoded in $d^{W}$ through weights that depend only on $\bar{\chi}$, thereby breaking any
  instantaneous feedback loop.
  This makes the operational definition of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ compatible with the pre-geometric status of $\chi$,
  while still allowing an emergent geometric regime for spectral and effective-field analyses.

  No dynamical equation for $\chi$ or $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is assumed in this construction;
  the procedure is purely kinematic and defines the conditions under which an effective
  geometric regime becomes admissible.
