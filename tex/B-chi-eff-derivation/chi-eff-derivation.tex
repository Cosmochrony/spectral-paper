\section{Derivation of \texorpdfstring{$\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$}{χeff} from Relational Observables}
  \label{app:chi-eff-derivation}

  The effective field $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is introduced as an operational description of
  $\chi$-configurations once a stable projected regime exists. Since the projected regime
  admits an effective geometric interpretation, $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ must be constructed in a
  way that does not implicitly assume the metric structure it is meant to support.
  In particular, if the distance $d_{ij}$ used to define coarse-graining neighborhoods depends
  on the weights that themselves depend on $\chi$, then a hidden circularity would arise.

  To remove this ambiguity, we adopted a \textbf{two-level construction} based on the explicit
  distinction between the combinatorial distance $d_{ij}^{C}$ and the weighted distance
  $d_{ij}^{W}$ introduced in Appendix~\ref{subsec:combinatorial-vs.-weighted-distance}.
