\subsection{Summary}
  \label{subsec:summary7}

  Particles emerge as stable, localized excitations of the $\chi$ field that resist
  its relaxation.
  Their mass, energy, spin, and statistical behavior arise from the internal
  topological structure of $\chi$ and from effective geometric descriptions valid
  in regimes where a spacetime interpretation applies.
  This provides a unified account of particle properties compatible with both
  relativistic and quantum phenomena, without introducing particles as fundamental
  ontological entities.
