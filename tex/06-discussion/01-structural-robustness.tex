\paragraph{Structural robustness beyond geometric descriptions.}

  An important implication of the present construction is that the robustness of
  emergent structures does not rely on symmetry principles or conservation laws
  postulated at the geometric level.
  Instead, it follows from structural constraints on the space of admissible
  configurations defined by the spectral filtering and projection procedure.

  Certain classes of admissible configurations are separated by topological
  obstructions in configuration space, preventing continuous deformation between
  them while preserving admissibility.
  This form of robustness is defined independently of any spacetime interpretation
  and remains meaningful even in regimes where no effective geometric description
  applies.

  When a geometric parametrization is available, such structural distinctions may
  manifest as stable localized or extended features.
  However, their origin lies in the relational and spectral organization of the
  underlying system, not in the geometry itself.
