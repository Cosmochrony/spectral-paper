\subsection{Local Relaxation Speed}
  \label{subsec:local-relaxation-speed}

  A fundamental constraint of the Cosmochrony framework is that the local relaxation
  rate of the scalar quantity $\chi$ is bounded by a universal constant:
  \begin{equation}
    \left| \mathcal{D}_{\text{loc}} \chi \right| \le c ,
  \end{equation}
  where $\mathcal{D}_{\text{loc}}\chi$ denotes the maximal local rate of variation of
  $\chi$ across correlated configurations, and $c$ coincides numerically with the
  observed speed of light.

  This bound does not represent the propagation speed of particles or signals, nor does
  it presuppose a pre-existing spacetime structure.
  Rather, it characterizes the maximal rate at which effective causal relations and
  geometric structure can locally emerge from the relaxation of $\chi$.

  Superluminal recession velocities at cosmological scales arise naturally through
  cumulative and global effects of relaxation, and do not violate local causality,
  which remains constrained by the bound $c$.
