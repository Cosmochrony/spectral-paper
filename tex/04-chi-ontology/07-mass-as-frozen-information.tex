\subsection{Mass as Frozen Information}
  \label{subsec:mass-as-frozen-information}

  Localized, stable configurations of the $\chi$ substrate—describable in effective
  regimes as particle-like excitations—correspond to regions where further relaxation
  is strongly inhibited.
  These configurations trap a fixed amount of unresolved structural information.

  In this interpretation, mass represents frozen energy: information that has lost its
  capacity to participate freely in further relaxation.
  At the level of emergent spacetime physics, this relation is expressed by the
  standard mass--energy equivalence,
  \[
    E_{\text{phys}} = m_{\text{phys}} c^2 ,
  \]
  where $c$ denotes the emergent spacetime limiting speed.
  This phenomenological identity reflects a deeper structural constraint governing the
  confinement and release of information within the $\chi$ substrate.
