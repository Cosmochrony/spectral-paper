\subsection{Energy as Capacity for Relaxation}
  \label{subsec:energy-as-capacity-for-relaxation}

  Within this framework, energy is reinterpreted as the capacity of projected $\chi$
  configurations to relax internal structural constraints.
  Energy does not correspond to a conserved substance at the fundamental level, but to
  a measure of unresolved structural tension within admissible projected descriptions.

  The deployment of structural information corresponds to the progressive conversion of
  intrinsic indeterminacy into relational differentiation.
  Energy thus quantifies the remaining potential for this conversion.
  Without intrinsic indeterminacy, energy itself would be undefined.
