\subsection{The $\chi$ Substrate as a Pre-Temporal Structural Plan}
  \label{subsec:the-chi-substrate-as-a-pre-temporal-structural-plan}

  In the Cosmochrony framework, the $\chi$ substrate is not interpreted as a physical
  field evolving within spacetime, but as a pre-temporal relational structure from
  which spacetime, matter, and physical laws emerge.
  It may be heuristically described as a ``structural plan'' of the universe: a
  complete but non-dynamical organization encoding the set of physically admissible
  configurations and their internal relations.

  Importantly, this structural plan does not prescribe a unique history nor a fixed
  sequence of events.
  Rather, it defines a constrained space of relational possibilities.
  Temporal succession is therefore not fundamental, but emergent, corresponding to an
  oriented resolution of structural relations within $\chi$ once an effective spacetime
  description becomes applicable.

  \paragraph{Infra-physical status of $\chi$.}
    The $\chi$ substrate is not described by physics proper, understood as a theory of
    dynamical fields evolving in spacetime.
    Rather, it belongs to an infra-physical relational framework that specifies the
    structural conditions under which physical observables, spacetime geometry, and
    effective dynamical laws emerge.
