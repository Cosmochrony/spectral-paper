\subsection{Intrinsic Indeterminacy and Fluctuations}
  \label{subsec:intrinsic-indeterminacy-and-fluctuations}

  A perfectly deterministic and fully symmetric relational substrate would remain
  physically inert: no configuration would be privileged, and no effective ordering
  could emerge.
  For this reason, Cosmochrony postulates the existence of intrinsic indeterminacy
  within the structure of $\chi$.

  For clarity, the term ``fluctuations'' is used only metaphorically.
  No underlying dynamical agitation or stochastic evolution is implied.
  Intrinsic indeterminacy refers instead to a structural non-determination of $\chi$,
  analogous to an incompleteness of specification rather than to random motion.

  Its role is not to generate dynamics, but to prevent perfect structural symmetry and
  indifference, thereby allowing relational distinctions to acquire physical relevance
  once projection into an effective spacetime description occurs.
