\subsection{The Role of $\hbar_{\chi}$ and Reprojection from $\chi$}
  \label{subsec:the-role-of-hbar_chi-and-reprojection-from-chi}

  In Cosmochrony, the parameter $\hbar_{\chi}$ is not identified with the quantum
  constant $\hbar$, but emerges from the fundamental structural scales $K_0$, $\chi_c$,
  and $c$.
  Its numerical coincidence with $\hbar$ in quantum regimes reflects the universality
  of action quantization across effective physical theories.

  $\hbar_{\chi}$ does not represent a quantum of action evolving in time, but a
  fundamental quantum of reprojection.
  Intrinsic indeterminacy of $\chi$ does not give rise to continuous emergence;
  rather, any reprojection of structural information into spacetime occurs in discrete
  units set by $\hbar_{\chi}$.

  As spacetime structure stabilizes, reprojection becomes increasingly localized,
  manifesting phenomenologically as vacuum fluctuations within otherwise stable regions
  of spacetime.
