\subsection{The Role of the Universal Bound $c_{\chi}$}
    \label{subsec:the-role-of-the-universal-bound-c_chi}

    The constant $c_{\chi}$ plays a central structural role in Cosmochrony.
Rather than setting a signal propagation speed, it defines an absolute bound on the
degree to which information can be structurally constrained within the $\chi$
substrate.

In this sense, $c_{\chi}$ sets the maximal confinement of structural information
compatible with physical coherence.
Beyond this bound, further constraint becomes impossible and relaxation becomes
inevitable.
Emergent notions of inertial resistance, causal structure, and mass--energy relations
are understood as projections of this invariant structural limit.
