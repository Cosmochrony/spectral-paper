\section{Appendix D: Numerical Methods and Technical Supplements}
  \label{sec:appendix-technical}

  This appendix collects technical and numerical tools used to explore the
  phenomenological consequences of the Cosmochrony framework.
  Its purpose is not to introduce additional fundamental structures, but to provide
  practical implementations and calculational schemes for regimes where the
  $\chi$ dynamics admits an effective discretized or coarse-grained description.

  The methods presented here serve as computational approximations of the underlying
  continuous theory and do not carry independent ontological status.

  This appendix provides technical details on:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The collective gravitational coupling and operational geometry (Section~\ref{subsec:collective-coupling}).
    \item Numerical algorithms for simulating $\chi$-field dynamics and estimating model parameters.
    \item Supplementary derivations and calculations supporting the main text and other appendices.
  \end{itemize}
  These technical supplements are intended for readers interested in the numerical implementation or detailed derivations of the Cosmochrony framework.
