\subsection{Scope and limitations.}
  \label{subsec:scope-and-limitations.}
  The present study is intentionally restricted to the emergence of geometric and gravitational structures.
  No attempt has been made to account for the matter degrees of freedom, energetic
  quantities, quantum statistics, or particle properties.
  These notions presuppose additional layers of effective description that lie beyond
  the geometric regime addressed here.

  Similarly, strongly non-factorizable or highly constrained configurations, for which
  no stable geometric parametrization exists, fall outside the scope of the present analysis.
  In such regimes, spacetime ceases to be an appropriate descriptive language,
  and alternative relational characterizations must be employed.
