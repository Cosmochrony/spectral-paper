  This study establishes a clean and minimal foundation for subsequent investigations by isolating the emergence of
  metric geometry from other physical structures.
  Extensions of the framework to non-geometric regimes, the emergence of matter-like
  excitations, or to quantum and statistical phenomena require additional assumptions
  and will be addressed separately.

  The results presented here demonstrate that a large class of gravitational phenomena
  can be understood as a consequence of the relational spectral organization alone.
  In this sense, geometry appears not as the stage at which physics unfolds, but as a
  derived and context-dependent summary of a deeper relational structure.
