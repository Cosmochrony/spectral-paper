\subsection{Outlook.}
  \label{subsec:outlook.}
  By isolating the emergence of metric geometry from other physical structures, this
  work establishes a clean and minimal foundation for subsequent investigations.
  Extensions of the framework to non-geometric regimes, to the emergence of matter-like
  excitations, or to quantum and statistical phenomena require additional assumptions
  and will be addressed separately.

  The results presented here demonstrate that a large class of gravitational phenomena
  can be understood as consequences of relational spectral organization alone.
  In this sense, geometry appears not as the stage on which physics unfolds, but as a
  derived and context-dependent summary of deeper relational structure.
