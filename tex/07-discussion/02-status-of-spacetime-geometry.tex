\subsection{Status of spacetime geometry.}
  \label{subsec:status-of-spacetime-geometry}
  Within this framework, spacetime geometry is neither fundamental nor dynamical in the
  usual sense.
  It functions as an emergent kinematical structure, applicable only when the
  projection from the relational substrate becomes locally injective and spectrally
  well-conditioned.
  Outside these regimes, geometric notions lose operational meaning rather than being
  modified or replaced by alternative field equations.

  This perspective clarifies the remarkable universality of general relativity.
  Whenever a smooth geometric description exists and admissible configurations vary
  slowly compared to the spectral cutoff, the standard geometric relations of general
  relativity are necessarily recovered.
  Einstein’s equations thus appear not as a microscopic law of the substrate, but as a
  consistency condition governing emergent geometry wherever spacetime itself is a
  valid descriptor.

  A more detailed clarification of the representational status of the effective
  geometric description, and its relation to the underlying relational formulation,
  is provided in Appendix~\ref{subsec:relation-to-the-effective-geometric-description}.
