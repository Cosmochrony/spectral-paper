\section{Discussion}
  \label{sec:discussion}

  The present work has developed a relational and spectral route to emergent metric
  geometry, deliberately avoiding the introduction of a spacetime structure as a fundamental postulate.
  Instead, geometric notions arise as effective descriptors of the admissible relational
  configurations selected by spectral filtering and projection.

  A central result is that metricity can be reconstructed operationally from purely
  relational spectral data, without assuming a background manifold, predefined
  distance function, or fundamental locality.
  The effective metric appears as a compact summary of the correlation structure in regimes
  in which admissible configurations admit a stable and approximately factorizable description.
