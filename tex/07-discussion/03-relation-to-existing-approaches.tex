\subsection{Relation to existing approaches.}
  \label{subsec:relation-to-existing-approaches}
  The present construction shares motivations with several background-independent
  approaches to quantum gravity, including causal set theory, loop quantum gravity,
  and spectral geometry.
  Unlike causal set models, no fundamental discreteness is postulated; continuity is
  maintained at all levels, with effective granularity arising from spectral filtering
  rather than from an underlying lattice.
  In contrast to loop-based approaches, no spin networks or combinatorial structures
  are introduced as fundamental entities.
  Compared to non-commutative or spectral geometry programs, the emphasis here is not
  on algebraic generalization of manifolds, but on operational reconstruction of metric
  structure from admissible relational correlations.
