\subsection{Relation to existing approaches.}
  \label{subsec:relation-to-existing-approaches}
  The present construction shares motivations with several background-independent
  approaches to quantum gravity, including the causal set theory, loop quantum gravity,
  and spectral geometry.
  Unlike causal set models, no fundamental discreteness is postulated, and continuity is
  maintained at all levels, with effective granularity arising from spectral filtering
  rather than from an underlying lattice.
  In contrast to loop-based approaches, no spin networks or combinatorial structures
  have been introduced as fundamental entities.
  Compared to non-commutative or spectral geometry programs, the emphasis here is not
  on algebraic generalization of manifolds, but on operational reconstruction of metric
  structures from admissible relational correlations.
