\section{Mathematical Foundations of Cosmochrony — Dynamics, Stability, and Analytical Solutions}
  \label{sec:appendix-math}

  This appendix provides a rigorous mathematical formulation of the $\chi$-field
  dynamics underlying the Cosmochrony framework.
  Its purpose is to support the effective descriptions introduced in the main
  text by establishing the consistency, stability, and analytical structure of
  the underlying field equations.

  In particular, this appendix presents:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the effective Lagrangian formulation and its hydrodynamic limit
    (Section~\ref{subsec:hydrodynamic-limit}),
    \item stability analyses of the $\chi$ field under perturbations
    (Section~\ref{subsec:stability-analysis}),
    \item analytical solutions in homogeneous, spherically symmetric, and planar
    regimes (Section~\ref{subsec:analytical-solutions}),
    \item and the relational foundation of emergent geometric descriptions
    (Section~\ref{app:relational_formulation}).
  \end{itemize}

  All results are derived from the fundamental postulates of Cosmochrony
  (Section~\ref{subsec:geometric-action}) without assuming a pre-existing spacetime
  metric or background geometry.
  Geometric notions appearing in this appendix should be understood as effective
  and coarse-grained representations of the underlying $\chi$ dynamics, consistent
  with the interpretative framework developed in Appendix~E.
