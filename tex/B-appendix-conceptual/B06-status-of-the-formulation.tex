\subsection{Status of the Formulation}
  \label{subsec:status-formulation}

  The formulation presented in this work should be understood as a minimal but
  structurally complete framework.
  Its core ontological assumptions, dynamical principles, and interpretative
  structure are fully specified, while several technical aspects remain open for
  further development.

  In particular, a fully covariant action principle expressed solely in terms of
  the fundamental $\chi$ dynamics, as well as a systematic quantization procedure,
  have not yet been derived in their final form.
  These open problems are not conceptual gaps, but technical extensions aimed at
  connecting the relational foundations of Cosmochrony with standard variational
  and quantum formalisms.

  Importantly, the absence of a finalized action or quantization scheme does not
  prevent the recovery of general relativity and quantum phenomenology as effective
  descriptions in appropriate regimes.
  Throughout this work, these standard theories emerge as coarse-grained limits of
  the underlying $\chi$ dynamics, rather than as independent postulates.

  The present formulation therefore occupies an intermediate but well-defined
  status: it provides a coherent dynamical and conceptual foundation from which
  both geometric and quantum structures arise, while leaving room for future
  refinements that may enhance its mathematical completeness and predictive power.
