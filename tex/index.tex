\abstract{
  We present \emph{Cosmochrony}, a continuous pre-geometric framework in which time, spacetime structure,
  gravitation, and quantum phenomena emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a single scalar field
  $\chi$.
  The field $\chi$ is not defined on a pre-existing spacetime manifold; rather, physical notions of time
  and geometry arise as effective descriptions of the ordering and correlations induced by its
  monotonic relaxation.

  Irreversibility is interpreted energetically, with energy understood as the residual capacity of
  $\chi$ configurations to relax.
  Spatial relations are defined operationally through gradients and correlations of $\chi$, without
  postulating a fundamental metric.
  Matter is described as stable, localized topological configurations of the field, whose presence
  locally constrains relaxation and gives rise to gravitational time dilation and effective spacetime
  curvature.

  Quantum phenomena are interpreted as effective descriptions of coherent fluctuations around such
  solitonic configurations.
  Entanglement reflects the persistence of shared $\chi$ configurations across spatial separation,
  leading to nonlocal correlations without superluminal signaling, local hidden variables, or
  fundamental wavefunction collapse.

  General relativity and quantum mechanics are not assumed at the fundamental level, but emerge as
  coarse-grained formalisms valid in regimes where $\chi$ admits a stable geometric description.
  Cosmological expansion follows directly from the global relaxation of $\chi$, yielding a geo
