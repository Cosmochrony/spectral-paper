\section{Cosmological and Observational Implications of Cosmochrony}
  \label{sec:appendix-cosmo}
  This appendix details the cosmological and observational consequences of Cosmochrony, including:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The spectrum of $\chi$-field fluctuations and their imprint on the CMB (Section~\ref{app:lowell_attenuation}).
    \item Resolution of the horizon and flatness problems without inflation (Section~\ref{subsec:cosmochrony_horizon_flatness}).
    \item Evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and its observational implications (Section~\ref{app:hubble_tension}).
    \item Numerical estimates of $\chi$-field parameters and their relation to observable quantities (Section~\ref{subsec:observational-estimates}).
    \item Phenomenological predictions for gravitational waves, MOND-like effects, and lensing (Section~\ref{subsec:phenomenology}).
  \end{itemize}
  These results demonstrate the conceptual compatibility of Cosmochrony with key
  cosmological observations while highlighting qualitative and semi-quantitative
  deviations from standard models that may serve as future observational tests.
  No full cosmological parameter fitting is attempted at this stage; the purpose
  of this appendix is to establish consistency, identify distinctive signatures,
  and motivate further numerical investigation.
